# riposte.conf.sample - Riposte sample configuration file.
#
# Rename this file to riposte.conf and customize it as desired. You must restart
# Riposte before configuration changes will take effect.
#
# Syntax:
#   string:  'foo' or "foo"
#   boolean: true or false
#   integer: 5 or -5
#
# You guessed it: this file is Ruby, so you've gotta use Ruby syntax. But
# Ruby's a real friendly sort of language, so don't you worry. Just pay
# attention to the comments and you'll be fine.
