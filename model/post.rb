        Congratulations!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now you'll probably want to get started tweaking and customizing. The
        first thing to do, if you haven't already, is to rename
        <code>riposte.conf.sample</code> to <code>riposte.conf</code> and edit
        it to set up your blog. Be sure to change the administrator username and
        password, and remember that you need to restart Riposte in order for
        your changes to take effect.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Once you've edited the config file to your liking, you can
        <a href="/admin">login</a> and begin creating blog posts and pages. You
        can also delete this post to make way for your own glorious words.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Enjoy!
